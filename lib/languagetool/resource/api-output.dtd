<!ELEMENT matches (error)*>

<!-- A (potential) error. The output is simplified XML to
make parsing easier for those that do not use an XML parser.
This means:
* the error element does not contain line breaks
* each 'error' element starts on a new line
* the attributes always appear in this order: fromy, fromx, 
  toy, tox, ruleId, msg, replacements, context, contextoffset, errorlength
-->
<!ELEMENT error EMPTY>
